This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

The project structure stems from [bulletproof-react on GitHub](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)


A page has its own feature folder inside the `features` folder, named after the page. Each feature folder includes:

1. `api` folder // for API calls
2. `hooks` folder // for reusable functions across the page
3. `components` folder
4. `types` folder
5. `screens` folder

This is based on the requirements of the page.
